# Compound Origins

Compound origins is an addon for the Origins mod that adds a multitude of mini-origins across several layers. Players can choose one mini-origin from each layer to assemble their own custom origin.
To assemble your own origin, choose "Custom origin" from the list of origins (in the vanilla origin layer).

The origins are designed such that ones in the same category are similar in strength and utility. Using a custom origin won't make the game noticeably easier - the lack of negatives in folk options is counteracted by defects outweighing talents. 
This addon was designed to be used together with Origins Classes, so it's highly recommended to use that addon as well.
