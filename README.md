# Compound Origins

Compound origins is an addon for the Origins mod that adds a multitude of mini-origins across several layers. Players can choose one mini-origin from each layer to assemble their own custom origin.
To assemble your own origin, choose "Custom origin" from the list of origins (in the vanilla origin layer).


This addon was designed to be used together with Origins: Classes, so it's highly recommended to use that addon as well.
